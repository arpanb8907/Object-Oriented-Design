1. Creational Patterns

Focus: Object creation mechanisms â€” make system independent of how objects are created.

Singleton â†’ Ensure a class has only one instance (e.g., DB connection). 

Factory Method â†’ Define an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses decide.

Abstract Factory â†’ Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.

Builder â†’ Step-by-step creation of complex objects (e.g., building a house).

Prototype â†’ Create objects by copying an existing object (cloning).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Structural Patterns

Focus: Composition of classes/objects â€” how to structure code for flexibility and reuse.

Adapter â†’ Converts one interface into another (like charging adapters).

Bridge â†’ Decouple abstraction from implementation (e.g., remote + device).

Composite â†’ Tree structure for part-whole hierarchy (folders/files).

Decorator â†’ Add new behavior dynamically without modifying class.

Facade â†’ Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Flyweight â†’ Share common objects to save memory (e.g., characters in a text editor).

Proxy â†’ Placeholder for another object (e.g., virtual proxy for lazy loading).

ðŸ”¹ 3. Behavioral Patterns

Focus: Object communication & responsibility distribution.

Observer â†’ One-to-many dependency (publish-subscribe).

Strategy â†’ Define family of algorithms, make them interchangeable.

Command â†’ Encapsulate request as an object (undo/redo operations).

Chain of Responsibility â†’ Pass request along chain of handlers.

Mediator â†’ Centralize communication between objects.

Memento â†’ Save/restore object state (undo functionality).

State â†’ Change behavior when internal state changes (e.g., TCP connection states).

Template Method â†’ Define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses override steps.

Visitor â†’ Separate algorithm from object structure.

Interpreter â†’ Define grammar and evaluate sentences.

Iterator â†’ Sequential access to elements without exposing underlying structure.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Concurrency (Multithreading) Patterns (less common, but important)

Thread Pool â†’ Reuse limited number of threads.

Read-Write Lock â†’ Allow multiple readers, single writer.

Producer-Consumer â†’ Buffer-based communication.

Future/Promise â†’ Represent result of async computation.
